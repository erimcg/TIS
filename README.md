TIS, the Thoracic Identification System, is a matlab program that trains and tests various classifiers with ECG and LDV signals. The software was initially developed by Eric McGregor at Clarkson University as part of an IC Fellowship Grant under the supervision of Dr. Stephanie Schuckers and Dr. Joe Skufca.  The software has subsequently been enhanced by Bridgewater College students Tayseer O'Brien, Troy Soaper and Dylan Tokotch.
