## Model Settings 

When you click on the Model options in the toolbar, the left pane will display a set of Modeling Options.![]() 

**Figure 9**

The first option is Algorithm Type which defaults to Homogenous. In the future there may be an option for heterogeneous identification, but it is disabled at this time. 

	The second option, System Mode defaults to Identification. In the future there may be an option for authentication, but it is disabled at this time.

	The third option allows the user choose between a probabilistic classifier and support vector machine (SVM) classifier.  The probabilistic classifier is based on the algorithm found in (1). The SVM classifier is from (2). When SVM is selected the SVM Options field will cease to be greyed out. The user may change the C and G dimensions. For our experiments, the probabilistic classifier is more accurate

	The three directories fields allow the user to enter where they would like the system to store files that are created when the system is running. To change a directory, right click on the field and choose a directory.
